## Getting Started

First, you need to clone this repository:
```bash
git checkout git@github.com:kleis-technology/cloud-assess.git
cd cloud-assess
```
All the commands in the sections below are to be run from the root of this repository.
We assume that you will run these commands in bash. 
If you are using another shell, please adapt the commands accordingly.


### Docker-compose

You can run the server using `docker-compose`.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The API specification is available in the folder `openapi`.
For a more interactive visualisation of the API, the `docker-compose`
also spins up a swagger ui instance. 
Visit this [page](http://localhost) to explore the endpoints, DTOs and run example queries.

### Local build and run

#### Requirements

To build the server, you will need 
* Java 17 (temurin) environment
* A [GitHub personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) with the permission `read:packages` to download packages from GitHub Package Registry.

Then, set up the following environment variables.
```bash
export GITHUB_ACTOR=<your GitHub username>
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<the token you just created>
```

#### Procedure

From the root of the git repository, run
```bash
./gradlew build
```

To run the server locally
```bash
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=localhost ./gradlew bootRun
```
The server should start listening for requests on `localhost:8080`.

Note that, if you are on Windows, use the command `./gradlew.bat` instead of `./gradlew`.


## First Assessment

Each functional unit is associated with a specific API endpoint.
For instance, say we want to assess the environmental impact of using a virtual machine.
The request takes the following form:
```json
{
  "virtual_machines": [
    {
      "id": "c1",
      "ram": {
        "amount": 32.0,
        "unit": "GB_hour"
      },
      "storage": {
        "amount": 1024.0,
        "unit": "GB_hour"
      },
      "meta": {
        "region": "sofia",
        "env": "production"
      }
    }
  ],
  "internal_workload": {
    "ram": {
      "amount": 10.0,
      "unit": "GB_hour"
    },
    "storage": {
      "amount": 50.0,
      "unit": "GB_hour"
    }
  }
}
```
In this request, we specify the usage of our virtual machine in terms 
of the quantity of RAM and storage used (in `GB * hour`). 
The request also includes the so-called "internal workload":
that represents the virtual machines that are necessary to operate the service
but that are not directly associated with clients.

Running this request yields an impact assessment with the 16 well-known LCA indicators.
Of course, in this example, we ran the assessment for a single virtual machine,
but nothing stops you from assessing as many virtual machines as you want.

## How does it work?

### Trusted Library

The ambition of Cloud Assess is to offer a library of *transparent*, 
*PCR-compliant* and *executable* LCA models in the sector of digital services.
More precisely, this work builds on the existing [PCR](https://codde.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/referentiel_rcp_datacenter_services_cloud.pdf)
for data center and cloud services.
The PCR defines 11 functional units, covering the hosting infrastructure (physical datacenter) up to 
more abstract UFs, e.g., Software Services.
Cloud Assess aims at covering the UFs at software level, but also UF that are not explicitly
covered by the PCR

| PCR No. | Functional Unit       | Status      |
|---------|-----------------------|-------------|
| 6       | Virtual machine       | âœ…           |
| 7       | Database              | in progress |
| 8       | Block storage         | in progress |
| 9       | Platform as a Service | planned     |
| 10      | Function as a Service | planned     |
| 11      | Software as a Service | planned     |
| n/a     | Object storage        | in progress |
| n/a     | Mail server           | in progress |

These models are specified under the folder `trusted_library`.

### Adapt the models to your taste

#### Structure

The models are written in the [LCA as CODE](https://lca-as-code.com) language.
This is a domain-specific language designed for the need of lifecycle analysis.
The models under the folder `trusted_library` are directly loaded in the server
to perform the assessments.
A [tutorial](https://lca-as-code.com/book) is available if you want to learn
more about the language itself.


The folder `trusted_library` comprises three folders.
* `service` : this folder contains the definitions of the PCR models, e.g., 1 hour of a virtual machine.
* `infra` : this folder contains intermediate models, e.g., pools of RAM or storage that aggregates the capabilities of the physical equipments.
* `background` : this folder contains the emission factors of the physical layer. Note that the emission factors published in this repository are mock values.
    Please, do not use them for real-world analysis.

Here is an illustration of this layering structure.

#### Editing the models

You can edit the models in `trusted_library` with any text editor.
In particular, you can fill in appropriate values for the `background`, or
modify the default parameter values of intermediate processes.

You will soon recognize that the top processes, e.g. `virtual_machine`, 
have parameters that are directly mapped to parameters in the server's API.
Actually, the server's job can be decomposed as follows:
* first, the server loads the models under the folder `trusted_library`
* every API request is mapped to a query to these models
* and the resulting assessment is returned to the client.
