## Getting Started

### Docker run

The server is available as a docker image.
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -v trusted_library:/trusted_library \
  -e SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE='localhost' \
  ghcr.io/kleis-technology/cloud-assess/cloud-assess-app:latest
```

### Local build and run

To build the server, you need to create [GitHub personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) 
with the permission `read:packages` to download packages from GitHub Package Registry.
Then, execute
```bash
export GITHUB_ACTOR=<your GitHub username>
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<the token you just created>
./gradlew build
```

To run the server locally
```bash
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=localhost ./gradlew bootRun
```
The server should start listening requests on `localhost:8080`.

### Swagger UI

The API specification is available in the folder `openapi`.
For a more interactive visualisation of the API, run
```bash
docker run -p 80:8080 -e SWAGGER_JSON=/app/api.yaml -v ./openapi:/app swaggerapi/swagger-ui
```
and visit the Swagger UI [page](http://localhost). 
There, you can explore the endpoints, DTOs and run example queries.

## First Assessment

Each functional unit is associated with a specific API endpoint.
For instance, say we want to assess the environmental impact of using a virtual machine.
The request takes the following form:
```json
{
  "virtual_machines": [
    {
      "id": "c1",
      "ram": {
        "amount": 32.0,
        "unit": "GB_hour"
      },
      "storage": {
        "amount": 1024.0,
        "unit": "GB_hour"
      },
      "meta": {
        "region": "sofia",
        "env": "production"
      }
    }
  ],
  "internal_workload": {
    "ram": {
      "amount": 10.0,
      "unit": "GB_hour"
    },
    "storage": {
      "amount": 50.0,
      "unit": "GB_hour"
    }
  }
}
```
In this request, we specify the usage of our virtual machine in terms 
of the quantity of RAM and storage used (in `GB * hour`). 
The request also includes the so-called "internal workload":
that represents the virtual machines that are necessary to operate the service
but that are not directly associated with clients.

Running this request yields an impact assessment with the 16 well-known LCA indicators.
Of course, in this example, we ran the assessment for a single virtual machine,
but nothing stops you from assessment as many virtual machines as you want.

## How does it work?

### Trusted Library

The ambition of Cloud Assess is to offer a library of *transparent*, 
*PCR-compliant* and *executable* LCA models in the sector of digital services.
More precisely, this work builds on the existing [PCR](https://codde.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/referentiel_rcp_datacenter_services_cloud.pdf)
for data center and cloud services.
The PCR defines 11 functional units, covering the hosting infrastructure (physical datacenter) up to 
more abstract UFs, e.g., Software Services.
Cloud Assess aims at covering the UFs at software level, but also UF that are not explicitly
covered by the PCR

| PCR No. | Functional Unit       | Status      |
|---------|-----------------------|-------------|
| 6       | Virtual machine       | ✅           |
| 7       | Database              | in progress |
| 8       | Block storage         | in progress |
| 9       | Platform as a Service | planned     |
| 10      | Function as a Service | planned     |
| 11      | Software as a Service | planned     |
| n/a     | Object storage        | in progress |
| n/a     | Mail server           | in progress |

These models are specified under the folder `trusted_library`.

### Adapt the models to your taste

#### Structure

The models are written in the [LCA as CODE](https://lca-as-code.com) language.
This is a domain-specific language designed for the need of lifecycle analysis.
The models under the folder `trusted_library` are directly loaded in the server
to perform the assessments.
A [tutorial](https://lca-as-code.com/book) is available if you want to learn
more about the language itself.


The folder `trusted_library` comprises three folders.
* `service` : this folder contains the definitions of the PCR models, e.g., 1 hour of a virtual machine.
* `infra` : this folder contains intermediate models, e.g., pools of RAM or storage that aggregates the capabilities of the physical equipments.
* `background` : this folder contains the emission factors of the physical layer. Note that the emission factors published in this repository are mock values.
    Please, do not use them for real-world analysis.

Here is an illustration of this layering structure.

#### Editing the models

You can edit the models in `trusted_library` with any text editor.
In particular, you can fill in appropriate values for the `background`, or
modify the default parameter values of intermediate processes.

You will soon recognize that the top processes, e.g. `virtual_machine`, 
have parameters that are directly mapped to parameters in the server's API.
Actually, the server's job can be decomposed as follows:
* first, the server loads the models under the folder `trusted_library`
* every API request is mapped to a query to these models
* and the resulting assessment is returned to the client.
